## Project description

We want to detect types of Pneumonia based on chest X-ray images. We found a dataset for it on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tolgadincer/labeled-chest-xray-images/data), so we didn't have to gather data from other places. The dataset contain pictures of normal (healthy) lungs, and pictures of bacterial and virus-caused pneumonia attacked lungs. The Kaggle competition was to classificate these images into healthy and sick patients, so the task was a simple binary classification, but we will want to do a 3-class classification. We can do this, because the pictures' file names contain the type of pneumonia it is (bacterial or virus-caused).

We want to investigate the topic further, than the participants of the competition, we will take a look at what models they used, but will investigate other methods too, to see, what model could perform the best on this dataset.

## Functions of the files in the repository

TODO

## Related works (papers, GitHub repositories, blog posts, etc)

Since the dataset is on Kaggle related to a data competition, we took a look to the other uploaded codes, so we could gather new ideas.

## How to run it

We used Kaggle to run the notebook, because this way we didn't have to download the 1GB dataset. So the easiest way to run the notebook is to upload the notebook to Kaggle and run the codes there. An other way is to download the dataset to your own machine and rewrite the file path. If you would like to, we can share with you the notebook on Kaggle, so you can just rerun it there, please send us the email address of the required personnel and we can grant access.
